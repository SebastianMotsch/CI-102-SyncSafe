Parth Vaswani - Freshman CST 
I am a CST major with experience in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java. I am passionate about becoming an entreprenuer and enjoy reading up on the latest technologies and working on simple projects which could fill gaps in the market. In my freetime I like watching sports with the boys and going out.
